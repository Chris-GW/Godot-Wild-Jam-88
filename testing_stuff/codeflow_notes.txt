----------GrapplingState----------

when initialized current_anchor = null

run:
machine.player_controller.apply_gravity(delta)
machine.grapple_control.handle_grapple

> what i want to do is have anchor_point and rope just tracking rope_end
  > and rope_end can stick to the player_controller while grappling

> use grapple_control for the grapple control movement etc,
but NOT for rope and anchor-point related stuff,
move that to anchor_point or to the state machine instead

----------AnchorPoint----------
some_target
	currently the detach point only
	is some_target the player_controller when grappling?
